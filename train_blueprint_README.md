# Train
You can use this blueprint to train a tailored model that classifies your text by pre-defined categories and priorities them using your custom data. In order to train this model with your data, you would need to provide a data of text sentence and their categories.
1. Click on the Use Blueprint button
2. You will be redirected to your blueprint flow page
3. In the flow, edit the following tasks to provide your data:
In the Train task:
   * Under the data parameter provide the path to the dataset
4. Click on the 'Run Flow' button
5. In a few minutes you will train a new text classification model and deploy as a new API endpoint.
6. Go to the 'Serving' tab in the project and look for your endpoint
7. You can use the Try it Live section with any text to infer the intent.
8. You can also integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page

Congrats! You have trained and deployed a custom model that can categorize and prioritize your tasks!
