You can use this blueprint to immediately classify the topic of a text received. For using this pretrained task prioritization model, you will need to create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be integrated with your data and application, in minutes.

Click on Use Blueprint button
In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
You will be redirected to your endpoint
You can use the Try it Live section with any text, i.e. "I forgot my password".
You can also integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page
Congrats! You have deployed an API endpoint that categorizes and prioritizes tasks!
