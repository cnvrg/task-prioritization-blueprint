Use this blueprint to immediately classify and prioritize a task’s text received. To use this pretrained task classification and prioritization model, create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be quickly integrated with your data and application.

This inference blueprint’s model was trained using a credit card dataset. To use custom data according to your specific business, run this counterpart’s [training blueprint](https://metacloud.cloud.cnvrg.io/marketplace/blueprints/text-summarization-train), which trains the model and establishes an endpoint based on the newly trained model.

Complete the following steps to deploy a task-classifier endpoint:
1. Click the **Use Blueprint** button.
2. In the dialog, select the relevant compute to deploy the API endpoint and click the **Start** button.
3. The cnvrg software redirects to your endpoint. Complete one or both of the following options:
   - Use the Try it Live section with any task to check the model’s ability to classify and prioritize.
   - Use the bottom integration panel to integrate your API with your code by copying in the code snippet.

An API endpoint that can classify and prioritize a textual task has been deployed. To learn how this blueprint was created, click [here](https://github.com/cnvrg/task-prioritization-blueprint).
